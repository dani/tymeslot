defmodule Tymeslot.Bookings.ConfirmationEmailsIntegrationTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Integration test that verifies the complete booking → email job flow.

  This test ensures that when a booking is created:
  1. The meeting is persisted to the database
  2. An Oban job is enqueued to send confirmation emails
  3. The job executes successfully
  4. The meeting is marked as emails sent for BOTH organizer and attendee

  Note: Email content validation is covered by unit tests. This integration test
  focuses on the end-to-end flow from booking creation through job execution.

  This catches real-world issues that unit tests might miss, such as:
  - Job not being enqueued
  - Wrong action name in job parameters
  - Job execution failures
  - Provider mismatches or configuration issues
