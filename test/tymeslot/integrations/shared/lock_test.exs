defmodule Tymeslot.Integrations.Shared.LockTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Tests for integration lock mechanism to prevent concurrent operations.

  ## Note on Process.sleep Usage

  This test file intentionally uses `Process.sleep/1` to test concurrency behavior.
  Unlike most tests where sleep should be replaced with `eventually/2`, these sleeps
  are necessary to:

  1. Hold locks for a duration to simulate long-running operations
  2. Create race conditions to verify lock serialization works correctly
  3. Test timeout and expiration logic

  These are integration tests for the locking mechanism itself, so the sleeps are
  part of the test design, not brittle timing dependencies.
