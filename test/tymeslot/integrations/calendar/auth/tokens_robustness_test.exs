defmodule Tymeslot.Integrations.Calendar.Auth.TokensRobustnessTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Robustness tests for token refresh error handling and lock recovery.

  ## Note on Process.sleep Usage

  This test file intentionally uses `Process.sleep/1` to test edge cases in
  the locking mechanism:

  1. `Process.sleep(:infinity)` - Holds a lock indefinitely to test cleanup
     when the process is killed
  2. Short sleeps - Allow time for async cleanup operations (monitor messages)
     to be processed by GenServers

  These sleeps are necessary for testing process lifecycle and cleanup behavior,
  not timing dependencies.
