defmodule Tymeslot.Integrations.Calendar.TokensConcurrencyTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Concurrency tests for OAuth token refresh operations.

  ## Note on Process.sleep Usage

  This test file intentionally uses `Process.sleep/1` in mocks to simulate
  slow external API calls and test race condition handling. These sleeps are
  necessary to:

  1. Create realistic timing scenarios where multiple refresh attempts overlap
  2. Verify that the locking mechanism prevents concurrent refreshes
  3. Test that the second attempt properly detects an in-progress refresh

  The sleeps are part of the test design to verify concurrent behavior, not
  timing dependencies that should be replaced with `eventually/2`.
