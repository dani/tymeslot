/* 
 * Scheduling CSS Loader
 * This file loads theme-specific CSS based on the active theme
 * 
 * Usage:
 * 1. For Quill theme: add class="quill-theme" to <html> or <body>
 * 2. For Rhythm theme: add class="rhythm-theme" to <html> or <body>
 * 
 * The theme-specific CSS files are self-contained and include:
 * - Shared reset and utilities
 * - Theme-specific variables
 * - All component styles
 * - Responsive design
 * - Print styles
 */

/* 
 * Note: In production, you should conditionally load only the CSS 
 * for the active theme to improve performance. This can be done
 * via Phoenix/Elixir by including the appropriate stylesheet link
 * in your layout based on the selected theme.
 * 
 * Example in your Phoenix template:
 * <%= if @theme == "quill" do %>
 *   <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/scheduling/themes/quill/theme.css">
 * <% else %>
 *   <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/scheduling/themes/rhythm/theme.css">
 * <% end %>
 */

/* For development/testing, you can import both themes */
/* The theme classes on html/body will activate the appropriate styles */

/* Quill Theme - Glassmorphism */
@import url("./scheduling/themes/quill/theme.css");

/* Rhythm Theme - Video Background with Sliding Interface */
@import url("./scheduling/themes/rhythm/theme.css");
