defmodule Tymeslot.Payments.Webhooks.RefundHandler do
  @moduledoc """
  Handles Stripe refund webhook events.

  CRITICAL: This handler protects revenue by revoking Pro access when refunds are issued.
  Without this handler, users could receive refunds while keeping Pro access indefinitely.

  ## Partial Refund Handling

  The handler now supports proper partial refund handling:
  - Calculates total refunded amount across all refunds for a charge
  - Only revokes access when total refunds exceed a configurable threshold
  - Default threshold: 90% of the original charge amount
  - Prevents unfair subscription cancellations for small partial refunds

  ## Configuration

      config :tymeslot, :refund_revocation_threshold_percent, 90

  Events handled:
  - charge.refunded: Refund has been issued
  - charge.refund.updated: Refund status changed
